\section{Description of the Algorithm}
\label{sec:DescriptionOfTheAlgorithm}
%Describe the algorithm you have used and/or developed. Here you may find it convenient to use pseudocoding. In many cases you can describe the algorithm in the program itself.
%Compute number of flops
About the algorithm.....

This is how we write c++ code in the report:

\begin{lstlisting}
// I am a comment

    double please define me;

    for (int i=1 ; i<n ; i++)
    {
        I do this for a lot of i's;
    }
\end{lstlisting}
