\section{Reliabilty and Numerical Stability of Results}
\label{sec:ReliabiltyAndNumericalStability}
%Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.
